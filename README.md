## Problem Domain: 
Music, specifically organizing music found on Spotify

## Application we're thinking of developing:
An app that allows a user to create and organize Spotify playlists.
We want to offer to create playlists based on artists a user wants to include, genre, mood (i.e. happy, sad, etc.), 
adding/ deleting songs or entire artists/ genres
We want to offer organizing playlists with functions like merging playlists, separating by artist/ genre, 
randomizing playlist order.
We want to offer liking/disliking songs and display the likes/dislikes.
We want to record the frequency of times a song is listened to.
We want to offer merging playlists between users.
